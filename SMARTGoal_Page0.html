    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 1.1: Explain why setting SMART Goals is beneficial.</i></b></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever set a goal before?  If so, what was the goal?  I wonder if it was a SMART Goal.</p>

    <p>Let’s find out!</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 1.0: Explain what the SMART acronym stands for.</i></b></p>

    <p>SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, & Time-Based.
    </p>



    <p><b>Specific</b>: Make your goal precise and concise.</p>

    <p><b>Measurable</b>: You should be able to measure how close you are to meeting your goal.</p>

    <P><b>Attainable</b>: Your goal should be feasible.  It doesn’t need to be easy, but it should be physically possible.</P>

    <p><b>Relevant</b>: Your goal should be related to what you want to improve or do.</p>

    <p><b>Time-Based</b>: Your goal should specify when it will be accomplished.</p>



    <p>SMART goals help you identify what you want to accomplish, how you’ll do it, and when you’ll do it.</p>

    <p>Now, let’s look at an example.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <p>Check out Juan, a 14-year-old high schooler who lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>

    <p>Juan dreams of being a professional musician.  But he knows that first, he must learn to play the guitar.</p>

    <p>Since Juan is Taylor Swift's biggest fan, he decides to learn one of her songs.</p>

    <p>So, Juan sets the following SMART goal for himself:</p>

    <p><i>“I will practice playing “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift on guitar from 5:00 - 6:00 PM every day this week so that I can play the song without stopping by the end of the week.”</i></p>

    <p>Juan’s goal is <b>Specific</b>.  It identifies the specific song Juan wants to play.</p>

    <p>Juan’s goal is <b>Measurable</b>.  He can measure whether he plays and improves at the given times.</p>

    <p>Juan’s goal is <b>Attainable</b>.  It is physically possible for him to play the guitar for one hour each day.</p>

    <p>Juan’s goal is <b>Relevant</b>.  He is striving to be a professional musician, and this goal puts him on that path.</p>

    <p>Juan’s goal is <b>Time-Based</b>.  The goal includes a deadline and the time that he'll practice each day.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <P><b>Learn By Doing:</b></P>

    <p>Which of the following are NOT part of the SMART Goal acronym? (Select all that apply.)</p>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Vague" value=.5>
        <label for="Vague">Vague</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Measurable" value=0>
        <label for="Measurable">Measurable</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Attainable" value=0>
        <label for="Attainable">Attainable</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Unnecessary" value=.5>
        <label for="Unnecessary">Unnecessary</label>
    </div>

    
    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Time-Based" value=0>
        <label for="Time-Based">Time-Based</label>
    </div>

    <button onclick="giveHint0()">Hint</button>

    <div id="feedback0"></div>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <P>Awesome! Now you understand what a SMART Goal is.</P>

    <p>So, what’s the point of setting them?</p>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 1.1: Explain why setting SMART Goals is beneficial.</i></b></p>

    <p>Your brain can grow.</p>

    <p>In fact, your brain is constantly evolving and changing as you live your life.</p>

    <p>It’s important that you are in control of how your brain grows and evolves so that you can have the knowledge and abilities that you want.</p>

    <p>SMART goals help us direct our own growth, so that we can pursue the knowledge and abilities that we choose.</p>

    <p>Let’s revisit Juan’s example to analyze how a SMART Goal helped Juan.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <p>Check out Juan, a 14-year-old high schooler who lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>

    <p>Juan dreams of being a professional musician.  But he knows that first, he must learn to play the guitar.</p>

    <p>Since Juan is in love with Taylor Swift, he decides to learn one of her songs.</p>

    <p>So, Juan sets the following SMART goal for himself:</p>

    <p><i>"I will practice playing “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift on guitar from 5:00 - 6:00 PM every day this week so that I can play the song without stopping by the end of the week."</i></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><b>Learn By Doing:</b></p>

    <p>Which of the following best describes what Juan’s SMART Goal empowers him to do?</p>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Juan will continue" value=0>
        <label for="Juan will continue">A) Juan will continue dreaming of being a professional musician without taking real steps toward the dream.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Juan is aware" value=1>
        <label for="Juan is aware">B) Juan is aware of what he wants to learn by the end of the week, and can measure his progress along the way.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Juan wishes that" value=0>
        <label for="Juan wishes that">C) Juan wishes that he could play Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off”, but he doesn’t have a strategy for learning the song.</label>
