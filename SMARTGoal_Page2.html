    <h1>Module 1: Set SMART goals.</h1>

    <h2>Learning Goal 3: Understand what makes a goal attainable, relevant, and time-based.</h2>

    <p>So we have a specific, mesurable goal. We're done, right?</p>

    <p>No, not quite! Now, you need to ensure that your goal is attainable, relevant, and time-based.</p>



    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 3.0: Understand what makes a goal attainable.</i></b></p>

    <p>This part is pretty simple.  If a goal is attainable, then you have the physical ability to meet it.</p>

    <p>Importantly, the goals that you set do <b>not</b> need to be easy to accomplish, but they should be possible.</p>

    <p><b>Example</b></p>

    <p>Meet Alexis. She is a senior at New Orleans Central High School and dreams of space exploration.</p>

    <p>She wishes to one day float in space, gazing at the Earth from afar.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>

    <p>Which of the following is an <b>attainable</b> goal that Alexis should set?</p>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will use my dad's" value=0>
        <label for="I will use my dad's">A) I will use my dad's car to build a 500 square-foot spaceship in my backyard tonight and fly off the planet!</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="By the end of" value=1>
        <label for="By the end of">B) By the end of the month, I will apply to at least four colleges where I can major in aerospace engineering, putting me on the path to become an astronaut.</label>
    </div>

   <button>Submit</button>

    <p>The correct answer is "B" because it is difficult, but physically possible, for Alexis to apply to four colleges that offer aerospace engineering.</p>

    <p>In contrast, building a functional spaceship in one night might be fun to try, but it seems physically impossible.</p>

    
    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 3.1: Understand what makes a goal relevant.</i></b></p>

    <p>This part is also pretty simple.  Your goal should be relevant to what you want to do, improve at, discover or accomplish.</p>

    <p>Let's revisit Alexis and help her set another goal, this time to help her improve in Algebra class.</p>

    <p><b>Example</b></p>

    <p>Meet Alexis. She is a senior at New Orleans Central High School and dreams of space exploration.</p>

    <p>Alexis also struggles in Algebra class. She failed her Chapter Two test last week, and she felt like giving up in that class.</p>

    <p>But, Alexis' teacher reminded her that she needs the class to become an astronaut. So Alexis is determined to improve in Algebra!</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>

    <p>Which of the following is a <b>relevant</b> goal that Alexis should set to understand the Algebra material?</p>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="By the end of the month, I will apply" value=0>
        <label for="By the end of the month, I will apply">A) By the end of the month, I will apply to at least four colleges where I can major in aerospace engineering, putting me on the path to become an astronaut.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will go to my school's tutoring" value=1>
        <label for="I will go to my school's tutoring">B) I will go to my school's tutoring session every day this week for one hour to do Algebra practice problems from Chapter Two and ask the tutors questions; then, I'll be ready to re-take the Chapter Two test on Friday!</label>
    </div>

    <button>Submit</button>

    <p>The correct answer is "B" because Alexis' goal is relevant to her success in Algebra class.</p>

    <p>Applying to colleges is great, but it won't help her to understand Algebra concepts.</p>


    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 3.2: Understand what makes a goal time-based.</i></b></p>

    <p>You've arrived at the last step of setting a SMART Goal! Woot!</p>

    <p><b>"Time-based"</b> means that your goal should specify when it will be done.</p>

    <p><b>Time-based</b> goals let you know <b>when</b> to check whether the goal has been accomplished and <b>when</b> to work on it.</p>

    <p>Let's revisit Juan, the 14-year-old high school student learning the guitar from our first activity.</p>

    <p><b>Example</b></p>

    <p>Check out Juan, a 14-year-old high schooler who lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>

    <p>Juan dreams of being a professional musician.  But he knows that first, he must learn to play the guitar.</p>

    <p>Since Juan is in love with Taylor Swift, he decides to learn one of her songs.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>

    <p>Which of the following is a <b>time-based</b> goal that Juan should set?</p>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="Taylor Swift's Shake It Off from 5:00 - 5:30 PM every day" value=1>
        <label for="Taylor Swift's Shake It Off from 5:00 - 5:30 PM every day">A) I will practice Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" from 5:00 - 5:30 PM every day this week so I can play it all the way through by Friday.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will practice Taylor Swift's Shake It Off a lot." value=1>
        <label for="I will practice Taylor Swift's Shake It Off a lot."">B) I will practice Taylor Swift's "Shake It Off" a lot.</label>
    </div>

    <button>Submit</button>


    <p>The correct answer is "A" because we are told the specific time that Juan allots to practicing "Shake It Off".  Juan's knows to practice from 5 - 5:30 every day this week. Go Juan!</p>

    <p>In contrast, option "B" does not specify when Juan will practice the song, making it difficult for Juan to ensure he has time to practice.</p>

    <p>Congrats on making it this far. You're crushing it!</p>

    <p>Now, let's put all of your skills and knowledge to the test...</p>
