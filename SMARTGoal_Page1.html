    <h1>Module 1: Set SMART goals.</h1>

    <h2>Learning Goal 2: Distinguish goals that are specific and measurable from those that are not.</h2>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.0: Distinguish goals that are specific from those that are not.</i></b></p>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.1: Distinguish goals that are measurable from those that are not.</i></b></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>First off, a SMART Goal must be specific. But, what does that really mean?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.0: Distinguish goals that are specific from those that are not.</i></b></p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <P>Meet Susana, a 10th-grader in Miami, Florida.</P>

    <p>After watching the Olympics with her family, Susana has decided that she wants to be an Olympic swimmer.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>

    <P>What is the most <b>specific</b> goal that Susana could set?</P>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will practice" value=0>
        <label for="I will practice">A) I will practice swimming.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly" value=1>
        <label for="I will correctly">B) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.</label>
    </div>

    <button onclick="giveHint21()">Hint</button>

    <div id="feedback2.0"></div>


    <p><b>Note</b>:  Specificity is a spectrum.  We want our goals to be as specific as possible.  Whenever you can make your goal more precise, do it! This will help you measure and evaluate how close you are to your goal.</p>

    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.1: Distinguish goals that are measurable from those that are not.</i></b></p>

    <p>Making a goal specific is nice, but you also need to measure how close you are to meeting it.</p>

    <p>Let's revisit Susana and make her goal <b>specific</b> and <b>measurable</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <P>Meet Susana, a 10th-grader in Miami, Florida.</P>

    <p>After watching the Olympics with her family, Susana has decided that she wants to be an Olympic swimmer.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>
    
    <P>What is the most <b>specific</b> and <b>measurable</b> goal that Susana could set?</P>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke." value=0>
        <label for="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.">A) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool." value=1>
        <label for="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool.">B) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool.</label>
    </div>

    <button onclick="giveHint22()">Hint</button>

    <div id="feedback2.1"></div>


    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Making a goal measurable makes it more specific, too! There's a big difference between swimming one lap and twenty laps with the correct freestyle stroke.</p>
