    <h2>Learning Goal 2: Understand what makes a goal specific and measurable.</h2>

    <p>First off, a SMART goal must be specific. But, what does that really mean?</p>



    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.0: Understand what makes a goal specific.</i></b></p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <P>Meet Susana, a 10th-grader in Miami, Florida.</P>

    <p>After watching the Olympics with her family, Susana has decided that she wants to be an Olympic swimmer.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>

    <P>What is a most <b>specific</b> goal that Susana could set?</P>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will practice" value=0>
        <label for="I will practice">A) I will practice swimming.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly" value=1>
        <label for="I will correctly">B) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.</label>
    </div>

    <button>Submit</button>

    <p>"B" is the correct answer because "swimming the freestyle stroke" is more specific and observable than simply swimming.  We are told the type of stroke that Susana will practice.</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>:  Specificity is a spectrum.  We want our goals to be as specific as possible.  Whenever you can make your goal more precise, do it! This will help you measure and evaluate how close you are to your goal.</p>


    
    
    
    
    
    <p><b><i>Success Criteria 2.1: Understand what makes a goal measurable.</i></b></p>

    <p>Making a goal specific is nice, but you also need to measure how close you are to meeting it.</p>

    <p>Let's revisit Susana and make her goal <b>specific</b> and <b>measurable</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>

    <P>Meet Susana, a 10th-grader in Miami, Florida.</P>

    <p>After watching the Olympics with her family, Susana has decided that she wants to be an Olympic swimmer.</p>

    <p><b>Learn by Doing</b></p>
    
    <P>What is the most <b>specific</b> and <b>measurable</b> goal that Susana could set?</P>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke." value=0>
        <label for="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.">A) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke.</label>
    </div>

    <div>
        <input type="radio" id="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool." value=1>
        <label for="I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool.">B) I will correctly swim the freestyle stroke for 20 laps in my school's pool.</label>
    </div>

<button>Submit</button>

    <P>"B" is the connect answer because you can measure how close you are to swimming 20 laps with the correct stroke.</P>

    <p>Making a goal measurable makes it more specific, too! There's a big difference between swimming one lap and twenty laps with the correct freestyle stroke.</p>
